# Create React App with Redux-Toolkit including MUI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes Redux-Toolkit along with Material-UI (MUI) for styling.

## Use template

To create a new project using this template, execute the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template react-redux-toolkit

```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and you can use the following scripts:

### `npm run api`

This command runs the JSON server, which provides mock APIs. You can access the server at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). The JSON server is used for demonstration purposes, and you can check the TODO app after it's up and running.

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. You can access the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## TODOs

Here are some tasks that need to be completed or ideas to consider for the project:

1) **Localization:** Implement localization to support multiple languages in the app.

2) **Keycloak & Authorization:** Consider implementing Keycloak for authentication and authorization. There might be comments in the code that guide you through the setup. Also, I've another library to simplify this setup, but please note that it might not be up to date.

3) **Other Authentication / Authorization Ideas:** Explore additional ideas and best practices related to authentication and authorization, such as using OAuth, JWT, or other security mechanisms.

4) **Redux Persist:** Consider implementing Redux Persist to persist the Redux store across sessions, ensuring data retention and improving the user experience.

Please feel free to enhance the project based on these tasks and ideas. If you have any specific sections you'd like me to focus on, please let me know, and I'll be happy to further fine-tune the document.
